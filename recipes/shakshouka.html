    <h2>Shakshouka recipe</h2>
    <p>Shakshuka (chakchouka or shakshouka) is a Tunisian dish of tomatoes, onions, pepper, spices, and eggs. It's usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make. It is similar to the Turkish dish menemen and the Latin American breakfast dish huevos rancheros.</p>
